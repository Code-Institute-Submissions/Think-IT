# Think-it: data visualization dashboard

This is a monthly sales data visualization dashboard, focusing on providing the data on each of their 10 store's: 
revenue, losses, leads and appointments. This dashboard provides the means to quickly view summary data for each/all the stores, and to compare their performaces. 


## User Experience

>Think-it is a fake company created for the purpose of showcasing interactive-front end design. It is a technology based sales company, specialising in technology solutions (i.e using technology to implement some improvement for home and businesses), that uses stores/calling to assess customer requirements (this is what is referred to as a "lead"). These "leads" are then converted to appointments, if the customer wishes to continue on with the sale and further plan their requirements.

This dashboard is designed to be linked to a larger site, for management level staff at Think-IT to be able to quickly and effectively view sales data on all 10 stores, and compare their results. Below you can read some specific user requirements, presented for this project:

* As a store manager, it's important for me to be able to view the performace of other store, so that I can motivate my salespeople to surpass targets.
* As a regional manager, I want to be able to quickly view summary data from our stores, in a easily digestible manner, so that I can produce plans and approaches to counter any loses in profits.
* As a store manager, It would help if I could see the actual figures of how my store is doing, in a simple format, so that I can not only see which areas we may be underperforming, but also what we do well on a monthly basis.

The overall aim therefore, was to design a dashboard with readily available information that would be of most relevance to the users (i.e: store managers and above). Currently, the dashboard displays the most desired metrics used to assess sales performace, identified by the users. Modern styling was used, with brighter colours to clearly display data, along with custom tooltips and descriptive labels to avoid any confusion.
